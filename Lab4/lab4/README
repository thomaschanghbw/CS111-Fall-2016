Both executables seem to work fine with no known bugs.

----Part 1----
Source file: lab4_1.c
Log file: lab4_1_temperature.log

----Part 2----
Source file: lab4_2.c
Log file: lab4_2_temperature.log

The Makefile has a default and build option. Both will compile the c files. It
also has a dist option for making the tarball.

Both Part 1 and Part 2 have LCD support. I implemented the support by piecing
together functions and data structures from various libraries. The executable still runs without the LCD display plugged in, but the output contains many error messages from the i2c library.

For Part 2, I also output to stdout for debugging purposes. This output matches what is put into the log file.
