I used c++ for this lab.

Included files:
	 lab3b.cpp
	 Makefile
	 README

To compile the program, use either:
   1. make
   2. g++ -static-libstdc++ lab3b.cpp -o lab3b

To run the program, use either:
   1. make run
   2. ./lab3b >> lab3_check.txt


I only tested on the disk image provided. The output matches the sample output when sorted. To test Error Check #3, since the error does not occur in the sample, I manually edited numbers in the csv file in emacs. The directory.csv does not have any entries for inodes 1-10, but the inode.csv file does. I assumed that since the sample txt file does not raise an error here, that I should not include these ten reserved inodes in the error check.
